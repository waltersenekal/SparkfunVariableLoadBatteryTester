# SparkfunVariableLoadBatteryTester
GUI for Sparkfun Variable Load to test Batteries

I purchased one of these Variable Load kits from Sparkfun to test my lipo batteries
https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14449

I quickly found out there is no gui for the device

So I decided to create my own application where you can configure what battery you want to test via profiles
Then it will run and and give you a report on how close the battery is to spec
This can be usefull if you want to build a battery bank and want to pair similar batteries together

It is still early days and I have only created the basic app so far that can run the test,
 
I still need to create the profile manager and the report generator
 
Any help from the community will be appreciated, c# is not my main language, I am c and c++ developer
